Subject: Application for One-Month Legal Internship (1 January 2026 – 31 January 2026)

Respected Sthavi Ma'am,

I hope this message finds you in good health. My name is Yash Uday Gupta, and I am currently a first-year, first-semester law student pursuing LL.B. from the School of Law, MIT-ADT University, Pune, India.

I am writing to respectfully request an opportunity to intern under your guidance for a period of one month, from 1 January 2025 to 31 January 2025. As a student at the initial stage of my legal education, I am keen to gain practical exposure to court proceedings, legal research, drafting, and case analysis.

An internship under your mentorship would greatly help me understand the practical application of legal principles and develop essential professional skills. I am sincere, disciplined, and eager to learn, and I assure you that I will carry out all responsibilities assigned to me with dedication and professionalism.

I would be grateful if you would consider my application and grant me the opportunity to intern under your esteemed guidance. I am available to provide any further information if required.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Yash Uday Gupta
